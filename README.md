# Snake-Game
A classic Snake game built using Pygame. The snake moves on a grid, eats red food to grow, and the score increases. Game ends if the snake hits the wall or itself. Uses arrow keys or WASD for control. Features include dynamic food spawning, real-time score display, and smooth gameplay.
